# File-organiser-on-Linux
System programming project. We noticed the problem with file organisation on our VM machines. There are a lot of files in different places. And we don’t  have a time to organise it.
That’s why we want to make a program which handle this disorganisation of files.

File: `fileorg.c` is the main program.

## Assumptions:

Program has following options:

 - Delete all children directories and put all files in one place to be able to organise them properly

 - Assign all files to directories by date of  creation, e.g. folder 2018, 2019 each of them consisting of directories with months

 - Assign all files to directories by type of file ( .c, .txt, .mp3)

 - Assign all files to directories by alphabetical order ( directories A-J, K-R, S-Z)

 - Assign all files to directories by type of group or owner
 
 ## Stages of project creation:
 
 - creating structures to keep all the files
 
 - implementing directories deleting option
 
 - Implementing files assigning by different criteria

 - testing
